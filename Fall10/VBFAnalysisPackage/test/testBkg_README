testBkg001.cpp
- not useful

testBkg_002.cpp
- nine four regions around the signal one, plus the signal one
- not very useful
- loop over events

testBkg_003.cpp
- m4 sidebands
- loop over events 
- PU reweighting missing
- updated to 19/09 ntuples

testBkg_004.cpp
- m4 sidebands
- direct fill of histos from collections
- PU reweighting 
- fill MC and data
- macro_004.C = interpolation test on W+jets sample
- macro_004_2.C = calculate scale factors from total sideband to signal
                  as done in the note of H > ZZ > lljj
                  get the extrapolated shape by means of the scaling  
                  super-impose the extrapolated function to the measured one in the signal region
- macro_004_3.C = test the Dan Green technique w/o fitting
- macro_004_4.C = simple plot of shapes
- macro_004_5.C = test the crystal ball fit on the MC shape in the signal region
- macro_004_6.C = fit the extrapolated shape

testBkg_005.cpp
- counting events
- direct fill of histos from collectioens
- PU reweighting 

testBkg_005.cpp
- counting events
- direct fill of histos from collections
- PU reweighting 
- base selections inserted

testBkg007.cpp
- new ntuples (19/09)
- check side-bands in mjj

testBkg_008.cpp
- compare side-band and signal regions
